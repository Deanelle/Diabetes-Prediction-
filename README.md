The Problem:

The World Happiness Report up to 2021 is an interesting survey that looks at the state of worldwide happiness of 153 nations.

Happiness is vital to living a long, prosperous life and I would like to examine the role that social support plays on healthy life expectancy to understand how they impact communities.

Social support includes things such as but not limited:

Physical or practical assistance (e.g., transportation, assistance with chores)
Resource and information sharing (i.e., information on community resources)
Emotional and physiological assistance (i.e., someone who listens to and encourages you)
Attitude transmission (i.e., someone who helps you laugh or see things more positively)


Questions:

Does social support mean longer life expectancy?

What can we learn from the data by examing social support?

Can the data tell us why are social supports needed in life or what potential impact that they can have?

Are social supports impacted regional? If so, what does this mean culturally? Does the environment a culture creates helps to add to if someone feels as if they more social support or not?


Hypothesis:

H_o: There is no statistically significant effect between social support and healthy life expectancy in population.

H_a: There is statistically significant effect between social support and healthy life expectancy in population.


Methods:

I ran a pearson corrleation test to examine the relationship between social support and life expectancy.


Data: 

The joy scores and rankings utilize information from the Gallup World Survey. The scores are based on answers to the most life evaluation addresses inquired within the survey. This address, known as the Cantril step, asks respondents to think of a step with the most excellent conceivable life for them being a 10 and the most exceedingly bad conceivable life being a 0 and to rate their current lives on that scale.

The columns taking after the bliss score assess the degree to which each of six variables – financial generation, social support, healthy life expectacion, flexibility, nonattendance of debasement, and liberality – contribute to making life assessments higher in each nation than they are in what would be considered a Dystopia.

This file contains the Happiness Score for 153 countries and looks holistically at the other scores that influence that score which provides insights into what these countries are currently doing or need to do to help increase the happiness of its citizens. The Happiness Score is explained by the following factors: GDP per capita, Healthy Life Expectancy, Social support, Freedom to make life choices, Generosity, Corruption Perception The data comes from: https://www.kaggle.com/mathurinache/world-happiness-report?select=2020.csv




Results: 

Based on a visual inspection and the correlation test, social support and healty life expectancy have a strong postive correlation. This means that the higher the social support, the higher the healthy life expectancy. The r-value being .723 shows this positve relationship. From this value, you can expect a strong correlation between these two variables.

However, in order to check for signifcance we will need to evualate the p-value so that we can decide if we can reject the null hypothesis H_o or accept the alternative hypothesis H_a.

Based on analysis, social support is not the only contributing factor to healthy life expecatancy. It is important to have social support( that feeling of belonging and access to supports in a society) but it is also important to have stable economy, and high feeling of life satisfaction as well.

In order to take this project a step further maybe examining two different regions or a few different regions and more predictor variables to examine wwhich variables are statistically significant doing regression analysis would answer the questions more completely.

Discussion and recommendation: 


Social Support and Healthy life expectancy have a strong positive correlation. Which means that as perception of social support goes up so does the healthy life expectancy. Meaning that having a strong social support correlates to having a higher healthy life expectancy. It is also important to highlight that it is not the cause of a healthy life expectancy as stated before.

However, this research still has implicatons for stakeholders who work as policy makers to make decisions about social impacts on health and why it is important to address the social needs of their constituents. Thus, helping governments to focus on cultivating a social environment that is suitable for encouraging the health and happiness of their nation by putting in things that make people feel supported whether that be emotionally, physically, helping people build strong friendships, etc..
